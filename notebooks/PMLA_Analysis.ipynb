       "\"problem of the types seems to be, in a new sense, the leading issue in contemporary literary criticism; not only are they summoned to offer proof of present usefulness, but even their identity is being doubted, and certain competent inquisitors have pronounced the nature of them to be that of wraiths and ghosts. A double assault has been made upon these time-honoured classifications, by certain estheticians on the one hand, and by an influential school of prosodists on the other. A fundamental dissension has arisen around the distinction between prose and verse. About this, indeed, it appears that rhythm does, in a general way, remain the accepted characteristic of verse-of poetry, some put it. No doubt prose, too, has its rhythm, characterized by variety. But in all generalizations-and it must be admitted that such a study as this is one of generalizations so long as a mere r6sume is attemptedthe predominating element may legitimately be taken as a sufficient characteristic. And the conclusions arrived at, providing the critic really does seize upon the predominating characteristic, will remain valid throughout all future modifications. Thus, recent phonetic studies, while establishing numerous facts hitherto unsuspected, endorse the accepted distinction that was founded purely upon the varying impressions created by the two modes of expression, and that were distinguishable merely by a predominant characteristic. One may reasonably go further, and maintain that if a characteristic is indeed predominant, there is all probability, in the light of experience, that this predominance is founded upon necessity: that, for example, the rhythm predominant in poetry-or rather, to begin with, in verseexercises there a particular function, whereas the non-rhythm relatively characteristic of prose is inevitable to the expression of the prose subject. But this is perhaps deducing too much from experience-making precedent the law, in the face of a formidable body of evidence tending to show that this precedent is indeed nothing but part and parcel of the traditionalism that has sometimes been found the bane of literature, Types in Literature and with which scientific research, and particularly the doctrines built thereon, have frequently come into violent and apparently irreconcilable opposition. But it is probably not the immediate results of scientific investigation, but the unscientific development of these results by those impatient to arrive at a system, at a law that will map out an infallible chart, it is evidently this headlong acclamation of truths but imperfectly understood that has played such strange midnight havoc in the domain of literature. Plots have been hatched against classical tradition, against the representation of evil, against any admixture of a humanitarian interest, against the presence of the personality of the author in his work-that strangest of all the aberrations of the theoreticians-against almost everything in turn, that has ever formed the theme, or constituted the method, of works of literature. Thus that delightful Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, with its Battle of the Books, fairly decisive, after all, for a period, but comprehending in its data so relatively short a period to be studied, that, unlike the theory of evolution, it might well be shown to constitute but a moment of reaction, a retrogression temporary in its nature. From that proud epoch of the Fasti of the universities, when, in Alexandria, professors of philosophy lectured in verse, the weathercock of literary criticism has performed its proper function of constant veering, sometimes, indeed, but slowly, but of later years, as it seems, more and more rapidly. We hear the querulous interrogation of Ackermann, by Proudhon: Why will Ackermann persist in writing verse ? It is but a futile diversion, if diversion it be, after all, since the possible combinations of rhythm and rhyme are shortly to be exhausted, leaving Ackermann and all such jugglers high and dry with their stale tricks. Whereas, Proudhon and men of his persuasion, healers and guides of society, need every hand to help in the final tremendous revolution of all things, when every reasonable being will be fed and nourished, doing his reasonable share in a reasonable pursuit-and when poets will attract no notice. We learn from the fair credo of Art for Art's Sake that humanity, taking it on the whole and on the average, might well be sacrificed on that altar where are engraved the perfect lines of supreme artist-poets -lines which may be no representation of known experiences, and perhaps better so, but taking their price from this very rareness, and from the perfection of their structure. We learn from the Petit Traite de Poe'sie Fran9aise, of Theodore de Banville, that rhyme is nothing short of God-given, that it is the 470 exclusive gift of the poet, and that he has it, and inevitably, and without seeking, multiform but unique motif of his expression. The continually recurring question has been one, and clearly distinguishable throughout all these vicissitudes of criticism-or of polemics merely: that of the pre-eminence, or of the absolute worth of a given subject for expression, or else of a given manner of expression: a deliberate ignoring, in each case, and in the face of practice, that harmony itself, and not this or that limitation of it, is the fact of literature. Which leaves the way open, it may be objected, to a perfectly coherent and precise demonstration of a law of natural science or of logic to take its place among the most finished productions of literature, which, indeed, it does, but at the same time by no means excludes the perfect poem, the perfect description, the perfect oration from the place they are accorded by general assent. Whereupon we need to determine merely what has been and what remains the typical expression of men, that which they have loved above all other things always: and we soon discern that the general striving of literature has been in the direction of completeness, universality of expression. Hence the second characteristic, completeness. And if emotion, whether awakened by a half-guessed sense of the divine, by love, by passion, by the visions of the actions of other men-the battles that they wage, the endless doubt and travail, and impotence of their lives-if this emotion is present in 'literature' over logic pure and simple, it is because men are first of all emotional, and are reasoning to a less degree, and because they choose to select and enshrine those expressions particularly (not only) which are distinctly coloured by this tinge of feeling. Which is by no means to deny in literature the r61e of reason; which is, on the contrary, to affirm its constant, not always evident, but perfectly indispensable co-operation with emotion, in most expressions. Some philosophers have proposed intuition as the fact of literature. Why veil the universal action of thought under so academic a distinction, which introduces us to a terminology the workings of which gradually lead to the conclusion that final effect, or impression, and not the means to this impression, is the sole test of the literary production ? And the theory would, as it seems, separate the work from its surroundings, in the sense of implying that each writer is sufficient to himself, or that a given architect, let us say,, of the days when the Pantheon was built, had within his soul the ogival tower of Saint-Ouen in Rouen. By no means, would be the reply, but, on the contrary, the tower of Saint-Ouen is a wholesome and creditable departure from the traditions of Roman 471 Types in Literature architecture, and it is precisely for this departure, this independence of tradition, this unwillingness to go on constructing Pantheons into eternity, sacrificing the real essence, which is the striving for independence, to tradition, that the ogival tower is significant to us. And yet, in Rouen, too, standing before the cathedral, we have the most vivid object-lesson in proof of the similarity of the Pantheon and the belfry of Saint-Ouen-the old romanesque arches of one of the portals growing visibly, in the succeeding courses of its tower, into the first severe point of early Gothic, and finally at the summit, into the most delicate and capricious type imagined by the later architects of that school. For schools there are, and types there are-not all, indeed, true ones, in the sense that they prove themselves in application and become under certain conditions indispensable to progress-but which always begin as experiments, and upon being found to be principles, continue, ipso facto, until something hitherto unrealized comes to proclaim them no longer serviceable. The iron spire of that same Notre-Dame at Rouen may perhaps be the symbol of such a revolution in architecture. The very history of types in literature shows the normal development of any discovery-the more or less blind searching for awhile, finally developing into practice in the work of some artist, and possibly, although rarely, perfected by him; and either the first to formulate the principle or the first to lend it the grace of conscious artistry is then hailed, and rightly enough, as an innovator. The form thus justified is enthusiastically reproduced with the new significances inevitable from every new contact, and directly the jinnee so magically dominating the heavens is decried as an empty cloud, and another is evoked to combat it. Yet the genesis of a true type is a process of evolution that is to be traced with ease, in most cases, through a series of well-accredited causes, and is not a mere perverse combination by some 'detraque,' some monomaniac, of disparate elements, 'et varias inducere plumasundique collatis membris....' Thus the rhyme that some have discovered to be a deliberate importation from oriental sources, imposing itself like a rude dancingmeasure upon the poets of the Latin decadence, was, consciously or unconsciously, present in the verses of the classic poets, as in those of Ovid. The stress-accent, too, was no invention of vulgar Latinity, but noticeable in the verses of the Age of Augustus. And the forms we class together as sonnet-through how many protean changes have we not traced them ?-the half-lyrical, half-logical short forms adequate for describing the single reactions of thought and 472 feeling, and which, if they have not taken, and never will take on absolute uniformity, still constitute a class. And it is a class which, if it is merely a convention, appears to be endowed with singular vitality to have survived some six centuries of use: it would appear that an approximation to the sonnet must remain so long as what we call modern European civilization continues. For if certain types, such as that of the short form labelled sonnet, appear, and have long appeared, especially adapted to our needs, it is not to be supposed that they will be, for that reason, eternal in expression. Just as we hear of an Arabian type, the 'kasida,' generally beginning with the theme of love in the pastoral spirit, and which is a longestablished vehicle in that literature, it would not do to suppose it susceptible of adaptation among us, nor, on the other hand, to deny it the distinction of being a type in that literature wherein it was developed, and where it seems long to have possessed every element of vitality. The solutions which have been proposed for this question of types have been various, some, like Brunetiere, giving them a racial or family history, and others, like Benedetto Croce, denying their existence for the artist. It is argued that as intuition is the motive of expressionexpression itself, indeed-and as the final impression of a work of art is nothing but the balance of these expressions intuited, and the final balance-the final impression-of every work being different from that of any other, the type, therefore, cannot be said to exist artistically. The appeal of this latter, eminently logical doctrine, is of course twofold: it is to the critic, and it is to the artist himself. The former sees in it an attractive primary division into two main types-the term will be excused: the first motivated by logic, which is critical, and the second inspired by intuition, which is lyrical-to use the Crocian expressionand which we know as 'literature.' The latter, the artist, finds in this doctrine a rehabilitation of what has been well termed the 'bardic' conception of the poet, exculpating him, before the fact and for ever, from any intellectual responsibility, and likewise from any possible invidious charge of imitation. The beatific, or rather, the Olympian sense of security of the artist endorsing this doctrine, and then setting about the writing of his sonnet, his novel, his 'free verse,' may be imagined. Needless to say, if there is a defect here, it is not on the side of logic; andcthis rigidity of method leads frequently to illuminating conclusions, such; for example, as that of the real meaning of the term 'unities,' around which critics and artists played blind-man's buff for 473 31 M. L. R. XII. Types in Literature generations, never discovering their precise nature, but thoroughly filled with a sense of their presence in the true work of art, their indispensability. There is no defect in logic, but it would appear that there must be a flaw in the fundamental proposition consisting, in resum6, in the thesis of the sole presence of intuition in the artist, who is, as such, not a reasoning but an intuitive being. It is no part of the present intention to enter into the merits of this position in so far as it is a question of the nature of the intuitive process, and of its intrinsic r61e in creation. But is it not positing the impossible that a man should be one thing purely when it is his very nature to be composite: that he should be emotional and nothing more, or logical and nothing more, or intuitive and nothing more ? The pure type of anything is indeed, in this life, something that can never be considered as a norm. Thus the work conceived throughout intuitively is difficult to find. The final impression, itself, of course, intuited, is-and the manner in which Croce makes this point is striking and illuminating-its result, its sumtotal. Only, this does away with the influence of the logical process in composition: for, the logical process being at work throughout contemporaneously, or rather, in the intervals of the intuitive process, the final expression is, indeed, not merely the result of intuition, but also of the logical process. And in two ways: the logical process mingled, as it will be, almost inextricably, with the intuitive, will give its final quota towards the sum-total of expression; the second influence will be indirect and progressive. That is, the status of the composition at a given moment will be influenced in an interval of the intuitive process by an intrusion of the logical, and upon the resumption of the intuitive process the 'status quo' will have been changed, creating a new impression intuitively upon the artist, who will thus be swerved from his preceding trend. And so on, the work progressing in a more or less uniform zig-zag course, bounding now from one wall, the intuitive, and now from the other, the logical, until finally the impulse, which is the will, is stopped by the intuitive perception that the work of art is complete; the final impression is the result. Thus the work of art is not merely intuited in fact. And in practice, what is the precise characteristic of this action of logic? It is undoubtedly consistent in the natural function of logic-the thought-process necessary to determine the probable reaction upon others; and the artist renowned as such among men is, as a matter of fact, precisely not what this doctrine would imply-a man of intuitions purely-but, on the contrary, the one most fortunately gifted with the right proportions of will, of 474 emotion, and of reason-the delicate understanding that we brand with the name common-sense, or logical ability mingled with the intuitive. The intuition is said to guide the reader, to give him entirely, in fact, the sum-total of a work of art in so far as it is a work of art. And strangely enough, it is thus-whether drama, or novel, or sonnetat once multiform and with unlimited possibilities. Byron's Sardanapalus, for example, may be at once the most powerful combination of suggestions-of vastness, of terror, of the quick and relentless workings of evil, of a world double-locked in the gloom of passion, under barbaric piles of splendour and injustice. Here it might be answered that the sonnet of Sully-Prudhomme, Cri perdu, gives a like final impression. Here, the poet meets a youth, one of the slaves who built the Pyramids, who, broken by toil, haggard, and mad with doubt, has wandered for three thousand years across the earth, crying aloud invoking God and justice, but always, yonder, Dans sa gloire, Cheops inalterable dort. The facts of Byron's drama may be different, Sardanapalus being no such eternal symbol of impassive and immutable wrong as is the Cheops of Cri perdu, and the luminous vision of Myrrha traversing the sombre halls of the Assyrian palace to burn out for human eyes in the pyre of the king may be the very apotheosis of devotion. But this is no matter; indeed Myrrha and the king merely serve to throw into blacker relief the evil that surrounds everything, and the sombre grandeur which is the final impression of the work is very like that of the Cri perdu. Each work of art is diverse from every other; but having proclaimed or admitted this, it may still be objected that the final difference in impression in these two works does not arise from the fact that the one is a sonnet, and the other a drama in form; and that a novel might have conveyed the nearest possible approach to the impression of Sardanapalus. As for the novel and the drama, it is another question, but so far as the Cri perdu and Sardanapalus are concerned, it is certain that, positing what inlitial intentions and feelings one will in Byron and in Sully-Prudhomme, the sum-totals of impression in the two works are materially influenced by the 'form '-deliberately chosen, it cannot be too often repeated, by each author. In the end one feels, mingling with the grandeur of everything in the palace of the king and-with the goodness of the girl Myrrha, the deep, black, and swift currents of envy, of ambition, of a Satanic revolt murmuring far below the halls of the palace, and this is a compositeness of impression 31-2 475 Types in Literature the very like of which, much less its fulness and strength, could never be approximated in any sonnet. On the other hand, the distinctness, the balance between thought and emotion emanating from the Cri perdu, are rarely found, if at all, in the final impression from the drama. As for the other objection, that Sardanapalus may be paired, for example, by Salammbo, or by Merezhskovski's Death of the Gods, it needs to be observed that not all the luxury, the wantonness of description in Flaubert's archeological novel serve to give his work the scenic relief, the justification of scene, the vividness of realization of the rl1e of plain and palace, that are found in Sardanapalus. So much for Sardanapalus as a dramatic form-and this in spite of the fact that Byron himself felt that it could never be acted; it is at the same time a composition in verse, a fact bringing in new elements, and particularly that which we may term sensory, establishing a clean-cut distinction between it on the one hand, and the two prose works on the other-and this notwithstanding that the presence of rhythm is striking in Salammb6. Thus, although one would be perfectly ready to adopt the statement that the work of art is intuitive-if by that might only be understood, predominantly intuitive--a wise, that is, a logical use of individuality must nevertheless be made. And here lies one of the reasons for the existence and for the use of types: the conscious conforming by the artist, on beginning, to a convention which will render his work more readily understood by others, and which, if adhered to, doubtless restricting the free play of his personality, is on the other hand likely to save the whole from futility by putting it into a certain consonance with general experience. Thus the final impression of his work will be as clear as possible, and more telling, generally, than if he had attempted to evade the use of the form. Or in other words, that the sum-total of his personality in the final impression is more potential with others than it would have been if he had not sought to render himself readable, that is, comprehensible. If the objection is made that this formality, pressing like a die upon every impression of the artist, warps it unrecognizably and thus dams the normal course of the artistic development, it can only be answered that it is here a question, not of theory, but of experience: the objection must be admitted, but it is natural in human experience in society that many things should be dammed in their natural course-their individual trend-and that much should be modified by the die of convention. Literature, if it is the expression of society represented in individuals-which, although a truism, will bear repeating here-is 476 bound to suffer, and is destined always to suffer, some such restraint. The result is not only a considerable check upon individual experience, but at the same time a body of literature that, without such discipline, might have been shattered in almost every attempt at expression, by the powerful centrifugal force of each individual personality seeking full play. Most individuals, as a matter of fact, shortly become tamed to a great degree cnough-by the repressions of society: the forms of literature are voluntarily adopted by all who are not supermen, as well as by those supermen who have the sense to recognize their futility away from mere humanity, and who prefer to be understood by humanity, foreseeing there a more immediate and more sympathetic audience than they could expect on Olympus. A parallel has, I believe, sometimes been drawn between the forms of language, the morphologic and syntactic conventions, and the forms or types of literature. But while it is this same desire to be understood that prompts the maintaining of both, the necessity in point of language is greater, and in point of types in literature less. But the identity of the first cause in the two cases is worth noting. Yet, on the other hand, the intrinsic worth of the literary type is infinitely greater, in almost all cases, than that of the language element, as being, not merely a symbol chosen more or less arbitrarily, perhaps, out of many possible ones, but a real psychological necessity, the single possibility in a given state of society. The type considered as a necessity, a principle of expression, may well be expected to take its form from the state of the civilization in question. Thus, the 'kasida' of the Arabians, the 'chanson de geste' of the early period in France, and the romance of chivalry, seem perfectly indigenous and perfectly indispensable in their several functions. But certain other types, as the sonnet, taking their life from an inextricable embrace between subject and manner, are types in a different sense. But the question of chivalry was a constant and supreme concern in a certain society, and the type having become established in that guise, it was only natural that it should be made the framework, in addition, for the other lessons of mysticism. The undoubted fact that a given form may be made to furnish as many final impressions, not only as there are writers using the form, but also as there are readers of each production, does not militate against that other fact, that there is a norm of human expression perhaps conforming to that of no individual, and that each type will be found to conform to that norm. But it may be replied that we can maintain but two, or but six, or but fifty true 477 Types in Literature forms-durable and general to an undetermined but considerable degree -and that these two, or six, or fifty so-called types convey absolutely countless final impressions. What, then, can be the reason for the form, especially when it is stated, moreover, that the final impression of a novel may be more like that produced by a given sonnet than like that produced by any other novel ? First of all, this last proposition may as well be denied, as false, since the characteristic impression created by the sonnet is very patently diverse in its nature from that of the ballad, of the drama, of the shortstory. Need these general differences be defined? A special study with such definitions in view might well be undertaken, since the distinctions already brought out have generally been from the aspect of the construction of each of the types. But, in the light of the fact already mentioned, that so many thousands upon thousands of final impressions have been given through the medium of a few dozen more or less established types, is it not perfectly evident that the definitionsif one can define impressions otherwise than by approximating them with others more familiar-is it not evident that the definitions will need to be most comprehensive? The clinical demonstration on a number of examples of each type will serve merely as a confirmation, hardly as a corrective, of off-hand suggestions of the nature of those final impressions from each. But the fact that definition in this case might well prove unsatisfactory, if not impossible, is, in the nature of things, no proof whatever that the types do not produce varying impressions, since the logical demonstration of the shade of an intuition may well prove baffling. The study would, however, have value in helping to show which of the so-called types are predominatingly realthat is, which may be termed principles of expression-and which factitious. The result of this outline is thus, that there appears to be reason for believing that some types are inevitable, and are relatively permanent, and that they are formed by the joint, or rather, alternating action of the intuitive and logical processes. But it is impossible to state with assurance that only the types possessing a marked correlation of manner and matter, the kind of mathematical precision that almost allows of demonstrated proof of excellence or of imperfection, that those types alone are real, and that, on the other hand, the types commonly classed according to subject-matter, such as the epic and the pastoral, are false. In short, the study, except as incidentally in rhetoric, appears generally to have been considered theoretically, or else with an invo478 cation of tradition-a perhaps justifiable, but irritating deduction that whatever is, is right. Certain of the types, in other words, possess for humanity a greater amount of reality than do others. But it may be found, as well, that some less-known forms are more intrinsically real than others commonly accepted merely because, as has been said, these ' great' types are more comprehensive, more lax, permitting of a closer approximation to the norm of society at large. In which case, there are two legitimate points of departure: the intrinsic and the relative, or the type considered in relation to the impressions that are rare, and in relation to those that are the most general.
