       "'Miscellaneous Notes The wishes are an important part of Prior\\'s poem just as they are in the other versions which we have considered. After the gods have made themselves known, as in Hagedorn, they offer to grant three wishes. The wife is quite ready to respond, but not with such wishes as Baucis and Philemon expressed in the other versions of the story. Her requesting a ladle for her silver dish brings forth her husband\\'s rebuke: What should be Great, You turn to Farce: I wish the Ladle in your A --. Consequently the third wish has to be used in getting the ladle out again. In Prior\\'s \\'Moral\\' at the end of the poem he makes it clear that without contentment there is no happiness. In a footnote to Hagedorn\\'s poem he quoted from Prior\\'s \\'The Ladle\\'. In his version of Philemon und Baucis Hagedorn, with his sensitiveness to form and rhythm which he had acquired to a great extent from English literature as well as from the classics, composed a fable of an Anacreontic turn, characterized by ease and charm. BERTHA REED COFFMAN NEWTON, MASS. THE PROLOGUES TO GOETHE\\'S \\'FAUST\\', AND THE QUESTION OF UNITY While there is much to admire in Professor Atkins\\' article on the early scenes of Faustl-and above all the fact that his admiration is for Faust as a living work and not as a corpse for hungry commentators-it may be felt that he is too easily dogmatic in speaking of the drama\\'s \\'unity\\' and over-ingenious in relating Zueignung and Vorspiel auf dem Theater to the body of the work. The purpose of this note is to query assumption and treatment and to plead for a looser conception of unity which is yet consonant with the greatness of the complete Faust. The Unity Professor Atkins postulates \\'the lucidity of dramatic motivation and poetic design that distinguishes Faust as a whole.\\' In that the weight of commentarythough admittedly much Faust-commentary weighs rather light-is behind a contrary opinion, Professor Atkins needs to present more evidence than he does here. And, though his method of attack is undoubtedly the proper one, it might seem that he is attacking from the wrong direction in giving his attention to Zueignung and Vorspiel. Some commentators, after all, have been honest, and it is a little hard of him to conclude that \\'the critic of so generally admired a work as Faust who makes its disunity a basic premise of his discussion either is grossly incompetent to practise his art or else is practising it with the...purpose of camouflaging an unfortunate patch of bleakness in...Goethe\\'s total artistic achievement.\\' Those who have written about Faust in recent years-painfully conscious of the disrepute into which the work has fallen, at least outside Germany and a handful of Germariists-have hardly started from any such premise. Indeed, our temptation is to begin from a basic premise of its unity and, in a crusading spirit, to manipulate events of the Second Part into fitting in more smoothly with our admiration. \\'Unity\\' and \\'disunity\\' are vague terms, and their need for definition is made the 1 \\'A Reconsideration of...the prologues and early scenes in Goethe\\'s \"Faust\",\\' Modern Language Review, XLvrI (July 1952), 362-73. 189 Miscellaneous Notes more obvious when Professor Atkins states that \\'if. . . Faust is not a unified work of art, it would be honest to concede that it is only an interesting failure.\\' Can one, with the best will in the world, neatly and cogently demonstrate the artistic unity of Faust in any accepted sense of that phrase? If approached under appropriate conditions, it has, I believe, a final \\'unity\\'-easily missed since so much of the material offends against the most elementary rules, and particularly apt to be missed to-day, when technical adroitness is the pre-eminent virtue of our artists and art is inlcreasingly a craft. That final \\'unity\\', I think, can only be suggested through the act of interpreting the play. Attempts to define it explicitly lead to the postulation of sonme \\'guiding idea\\'-which certainly seems dishonesty when we set it against Goethe\\'s text. What the critic has to show is how, in spite of appearances, the end of the Second Part is directly related to the beginning of the First Part and hoxw much (though not all) of what happens between is relevant more and less obviously to the human Faust as well as to the allegorical hero. In view of the storms which f\\'ace him dturing the Second Part, he will be well advised not to make heavy weather of the set-pieces which precede Prolog im Himmel. Zueignung \\'Nothing is lost, and much is gained, if Zueignung is recognized as a spoken prologue to Faust\\'-Professor Atkins refers to the conventional modesty of the prologue, to Goethe\\'s avoidance of the first person nominative \\'except in doubting questions\\', and to the diffidence of his allusion to the \\'applause or approval w\\\\hich custom demands\\'. Calvin Thomas\\'s comments seem more apt: \\'These fine stanzas are in no sense a part of the drama of Faust, but simply an \" occasional\" lyric. The poet, now in middle life, has determined to resume work upon Faust.\\' It is, as Thomas remarks, a dedication of himself to the task ahead-rather than a dedication to the theatre audience. Zueignung has all the appearances of an \\'occasional\\' lyric written for a particular occasion: the printing of Faust. Pace Professor Atkins, a poem can be personal without repetition of the emphatic \\'I\\', and in fact the \\'doubting questions\\' endow the piece with a strong flavour of the intimately personal. The allusions to dead friends (\\'Der Schmerz wird neu...\\') strike a note inimical to theatre, while what follows \\' Sie h6ren nicht die folgenden Gesange...\\' -would cast a gloom over any living audience. The poet is more interested, here, in those who have passed away than in those who are present, and this is emphasized by the reference, \\'Ihr Beifall selbst macht meinemn Herzen bang\\'-less diffidence than a pointed (and, for a spoken prologue, rather tactless) rejection of applause in advance, while the final couplet (\\'Was ich besitze seh\\' ich wie im Weiten.. .\\') would be less out of place after the curtain\\'s fall than before its rising. The \\'occasion\\' is sentimental and private rather than dramatic and public the return of the middle-aged poet to the imaginative scenes of his youth-and its relevance is to his life, not to his work. The question might not merit discussion but for the implications of Professor Atkins\\' treatment: \\'Without Zueignung... the underlying earnestness of Vorspiel might well be disregarded... but Vorspiel must surely be more than satiric comedy if the next scene, Prolog im Himmel, is to be given serious attention.\\' This proposition may strike us as somewhat derogatory to Prolog, an extremely impressive piece of work, which should need no prior advertisement or gloss: the gravity of Mephistopheles\\' cynicism and of the Lord\\'s caln assurance should enforce itself Miscellaneous Notes 191 upon any audience but the most backward. Yet Professor Atkins\\' fear lest it might be mistaken for pastiche finds alarming confirmation in Croce, who complains of \\'a dEgage manner, slightly in the style of Voltaire\\'. Even so, an author cannot insure himself against misinterpretation, and ideas which are so violently preconceived will hardly be removed by a score of prologues. Zueignung is \\'to make unambiguously clear that...the following drama is fundamentally serious\\'. But \\'the following drama\\' alone is in a position to make its seriousness clear. As far as Prolog is concerned, poetic weight against poetic weight, Vorspiel seems to me to lead away from it rather than up to it. Vorspiel auf dem Theater Professor Atkins describes this as \\'a continuation of that first prologue in an impersonal form\\'. It is true that \\'the shift from flexible rhymed verse to strict ottava rima exemplifies within Vorspiel the metrical flexibility of the text to follow\\'-though it is not exactly as metrical flexibility that the difficulty of Faust presents itself. The real objection to this view of Vorspiel is suggested by Professor Atkins\\' remark, apropos of the fact that most commentators recognize Prolog as the real beginning of the dramatic action: \\'The inconsistency of discriminating between prologues naturally does not trouble critics who regard Faust as a pleasing dramatico-lyric melange.\\' The two assumptions here are (a) that critics who so discriminate necessarily regard Faust as no more than \\'a pleasing dramatico-lyric melange\\' and (b) that it is inconsistent to discriminate. Surely scholar as well as interpreter lives by discrimination ? The point to stress is\\'that in poetry\\' significance\\' cannot be separated from \\'quality\\'. Perhaps it is only when one approaches the prologues as \\'prose\\' collections of symbols later to be repeated, of preparatives or of ideas (as such), that one can avoid discriminating between the light jocularity of Vorspiel and the powerful, urgent and grim jocularity of Mephistopheles\\' Prolog speeches. All fish is not salmon because salmon is fish; and discrimination is not only necessary but also natural. In spite of some forcible aphorisms, the poetic pressure of Vorspiel is comparatively low; it has certain characteristics of the set debate. Passing to Prolog, however, we are at once aware that the debate is there conducted in accents of a deeper sincerity: the untroubled confidence of the Lord and the cynical assurance of Mephistopheles, both claiming our sympathy, collide and co-exist in a state of tension not to be felt in the arguments of Director, Dichter and Lustige Person. Prolog im Himmel is the important, crucial, scene among these prologues-not merely because it announces themes and broaches ideas, but because it does this in poetry of a high order. We may doubt whether Prolog needs \\'underlining\\': in any case,, is Vorspiel of such metal that it could ever be a key to the massive doors of Faust? And what is to provide a key to Zueignung and Vorspiel? Yet possibly Professor Atkins is right in suggesting that commentators have dismissed Vorspiel a little too casually. He relates it in an interesting and stimulating way to Studirzimmer II. Vorspiel and Studirzimmer II In Studirzimmer II Faust aspires to share all human experience, weal and woe. \\'Associirt euch mit einem Poeten\\' (\\'Herrn Mikrokosmus\\'), Mephistopheles jeers. Professor Atkins sees here a reintroduction of Vorspiel themes: \\'Mephistopheles Miscellaneous Notes is plausibly depreciating Faust\\'s will to experience the lot of all mankind in a single (symbolic) human life, and yet at the same time it is ironically implied...that poetry can be the one valid means of stating a vision of life as meaningful totality.\\' He then states that the antithesis between Dichter in the high sense and Poet in Mephistopheles\\' pejorative sense cannot be made, in Faust, without the Vorspiel. I doubt whether so much weight can be given to the Dichter in the trio-debate of Vorspiel: a different interpretation of the \\'balance of power\\' between the three speakers is possible. The Dichter\\'s first speech, in the metre of Zueignung, echoes-and then exaggerates-its sentiments. He too chooses \\'Lieb\\' und Freundschaft\\' but is more emphatically averse to the \\'general public\\'. Eminently the Romantic Poet, he asks for an Ivory Tower in tones which lack the quiet sincerity of Zueignung, and his attitude is effectively mocked by the Lustige Person. The latter makes a strong, not merely Mephisto-cynical, point: \\'Wer sich behaglich mitzutheilen weiss....\\' He seems a less partial witness than the Dichter and, in spite of a natural zeal for his own calling, the view he propounds is not unbalanced: \\'Lasst Phantasie, mit allen ihren Ch6ren\\' etc. The Director is not merely mercenary, and if his allusions to \\'Solch ein Ragout\\' are calculated to arouse the indignation of any true poet, yet he too has the right to a certain indignation with this particular Poet-\\' Was traumet ihr auf eurer Dichter-Hohe?\\' But the Dichter\\'s third speech is unequivocally meant-\\' Wer ruft das Einzelne zur allgemeinen Weihe\\' etc. The Lustige Person advises him, \\'Greift nur hinein in\\'s volle Menschenleben!\\' And though the latter over-states, his suggestion that artistic creation should resemble a love affair, unplanned and spontaneous, is interesting in view of what follows. On his final appearance the Dichter recurs to the strain of melancholy nostalgia with a rather self-conscious glance back at \\'Sturm und Drang\\'-\\' Gib meine Jugend mir zuriick !\\' The Lustige Person speaks up for the middle-aged Goethe, but the Director is allowed the last word-one that will echo, with increasing significance, throughout Faust: Der Worte sind genug gewechselt, Lasst mich auch endlich Thaten sehn. As Calvin Thomas comments: \\'Of course the Poet is Goethe, but-so is the Manager and the Comedian.\\' The Dichter of Vorspiel is far from representing the whole of Goethe: he is too narrowly, too consciously, \\'the poet\\'. His colleagues help to correct his attitude, reminding him of art\\'s human implications. Returning to Studirzimmer II, it might appear that the irony which Professor Atkins observes is, however, of a different kind. Mephistopheles corrects the highflown \\'romantic\\' attitude of Faust-\\'Du bist am Ende-was du bist\\'-rather as Director and Lustige Person modify the Dichter\\'s aestheticism. For Mephistopheles\\' most vicious attacks are often based in salutary commonsense-cf. Banquo on \\'the instruments of darkness\\'. The arriere-pensee is clear enough: only in active life can Faust vindicate Mephistopheles\\' cynicism. None the less, Mephistopheles\\' advice, up to that point, is good: only in active life can Faust vindicate the Lord\\'s optimism. The Director\\'s cry for \\'deeds\\' looks forward, through Mephistopheles\\' mockery of Faust\\'s literary cosmic yearnings, to the late Faust\\'s words: \\'Der Erdenkreis ist mir genug bekannt...\\' While one should not deny the presence of the Dichter-Poet antithesis, the more important one is that between Literature and 192 Mliscellaneous Notes 193 Life-between impossible, destructive aspiration and the life of deeds of the Erdenkreis. In stressing the former antithesis at the expense of the latter, Professor Atkins is blurring the drama\\'s humanity: Faust, among other things, is a warning not to confuse life with literature. How useful, though, is Vorspiel in clarifying this antithesis? In commentary it is easy to be wise after the event, and it may well be that Studirzimmer II (backed up by the condition of the later Faust) illuminates Vorspiel rather than the other way about. The Question of Unity Professor Atkins twice refers to Faust as a tragedy. But it is likely that the peculiar difficulties experienced in investigating the work\\'s unity are connected with the fact that it is not one. With its tragic First Part, its middle scenes of comedy, allegory and lyricism, and the compelling \\'reconciliation\\' of its conclusion, Faust is nearer to The Winter\\'s Tale than to Hamlet. And the critic of tragi-comedy requires a subtler conception of \\'unity\\' than that which we carry with us elsewhere. I doubt whether a useful purpose is served by assuming that Walpurgisnacht can have its full original effect nowadays-or that, for instance, Classische Walpurgisnacht fits justly and unobtrusively into the complete work. On the other hand, one would not support such ventures as Mr Louis MacNeice\\'s two-thirds abridgment or condone what the dust-cover of his translation calls \\'the essential Faust\\'. Those who look forward to Faust\\'s recognition as a living masterpiece must hope that Professor Atkins will turn his attention to the genuine and unique problems posed by the \\'inside\\' of this unique work. D. J. ENRIGHT BIRMINGHAM THE PROLOGUES TO GOETHE\\'S \\'FAUST\\', AND THE QUESTION OF UNITY: A PARTLAL REPLY Dr Enright observes that in my reconsideration of the prologues and early scenes in Faust I fail to support with evidence my assumption that Faust as a whole is distinguished by \\'lucidity of dramatic motivation and poetic design\\'. Since my remarks were concerned almost exclusively with half of a text itself far less than half of the whole Faust, I pointed out the weakness of certain \\'fragmentarian\\' arguments with the sole purpose of encouraging my readers to look with me at the first part of Faust I without biographical and cultural-historical prejudice. Although considerations of space prevent my demonstrating, \\'convincingly\\' or unconvincingly, the unity of Faust here, I nevertheless assure Dr Enright, and perhaps others, that I do not postulate a \\'guiding idea\\' in any overtly narrow sense of the phrase. If but a few elements of Goethe\\'s drama are brought into better focus than they were in before and can now be exploited more advantageously in the interpretation of it as a whole, my article will have served a sufficient purpose. Three questions, however, can be given some answer. (1) Is Zueignung not a prologue because it has \\'a strong flavour of the intimately personal\\'? Perhaps-but I would still suggest that the \\'intimately personal\\' might not be recognized by one unfamiliar with the history of the text of Faust and with Goethe\\'s biography, and that those who read Faust as primarily a lyric might nevertheless consistently regard Zueignung as the M.L.R.
